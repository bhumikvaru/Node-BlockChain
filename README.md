# Simple Blockchain in Node.js

This project demonstrates a basic implementation of a blockchain using Node.js. It's designed for educational purposes to help understand the core concepts behind blockchain technology.

## Features

- Create a simple blockchain
- Add new blocks with transaction data
- Implement basic Proof of Work algorithm
- Verify the integrity of the blockchain

## Prerequisites

- Node.js (v12.0.0 or higher recommended)
- npm (usually comes with Node.js)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/nodejs-blockchain-example.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```
   cd nodejs-blockchain-example
   ```

3. Install dependencies:
   ```
   npm install
   ```

## Usage

Run the main script to create a blockchain and add some sample blocks:




####node blockchain.js


This will create a new blockchain, add a couple of blocks, and print the resulting blockchain to the console.

## Code Structure

- `blockchain.js`: The main file containing the blockchain implementation
- `createBlock()`: Function to create a new block
- `computeHash()`: Function to compute the hash of a block
- `proofOfWork()`: Function to implement the Proof of Work algorithm
- `createBlockchain()`: Function to create and manage the blockchain

## Customization

You can modify the `difficulty` variable in the `createBlockchain()` function to adjust the mining difficulty. Higher values will require more computational work to mine a block.

## Disclaimer

This is a basic implementation for educational purposes and is not suitable for production use. Real-world blockchain systems are much more complex and include additional features for security, scalability, and consensus.
